3. Select specific model variants for each provider

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### Quick Test

1. Navigate to **Test New Components** page
2. Click **Claude vs DeepSeek Test**
3. Enter a test prompt
4. Test both AI models
5. Compare response times and quality

### What to Test

- **Simple Questions**: "What is the capital of France?"
- **Creative Tasks**: "Write a short story about a robot"
- **Analysis**: "Analyze the benefits of renewable energy"
- **Code Generation**: "Create a React component for a todo list"

## üîß API Endpoints

### Claude Main API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/ai/claude`
- **Use Case**: General AI tasks, image analysis, structured output
- **Features**: Vision support, structured JSON responses

### Claude Chat API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/ai/claude-chat`
- **Use Case**: Conversational AI, chat-based interactions
- **Features**: Multi-turn conversations, context awareness

### Automatic Routing
- **Endpoint**: `/api/ai`
- **Use Case**: Main AI endpoint that automatically routes to preferred provider
- **Features**: Smart routing based on user preferences

## üìä Model Comparison

### Claude Models
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Default): Balanced performance, excellent reasoning
- **Claude 3 Opus**: Most capable, highest quality responses
- **Claude 3 Haiku**: Fastest, good for simple tasks

### DeepSeek Models
- **DeepSeek Chat**: Fast and efficient general purpose
- **DeepSeek Coder**: Specialized for code generation

## üéØ Use Cases

### When to Use Claude
- **Complex reasoning tasks**
- **Creative writing and analysis**
- **Image analysis and understanding**
- **Structured data generation**
- **Academic or research tasks**

### When to Use DeepSeek
- **Code generation and debugging**
- **Technical analysis**
- **Fast responses for simple queries**
- **Cost-effective processing**

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Claude API key not configured"**
   - Check your API key in settings
   - Ensure the key is valid and active
   - Verify the key has proper permissions

2. **"API error: 401"**
   - Invalid or expired API key
   - Check your Anthropic account status
   - Verify billing and usage limits

3. **"No response generated"**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the prompt is not too long
   - Try a simpler test query

4. **Slow response times**
   - Claude models can be slower than DeepSeek
   - Check your internet connection
   - Consider using Claude Haiku for speed

### Performance Tips

1. **Use appropriate models** for your task type
2. **Keep prompts concise** for faster responses
3. **Test both providers** to find the best fit
4. **Monitor API usage** to avoid rate limits

## üîÑ Migration from DeepSeek

### Gradual Transition
1. **Start with testing**: Use the comparison tool to evaluate both
2. **Identify use cases**: Determine which tasks work better with each AI
3. **Set preferences**: Configure your preferred provider for different scenarios
4. **Monitor performance**: Track response quality and speed

### Fallback Strategy
- If Claude fails, the system automatically falls back to DeepSeek
- Both APIs are called independently, ensuring reliability
- Error handling provides graceful degradation

## üìà Performance Metrics

### What to Measure
- **Response Time**: How fast each AI responds
- **Response Quality**: Length, accuracy, and relevance
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful API calls
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cost per response (if applicable)

### Benchmarking
- Test with identical prompts across both AIs
- Use the built-in comparison tool
- Document performance patterns for your use cases
- Adjust preferences based on results

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Structured Output
- Both AIs support structured JSON responses
- Useful for data extraction and formatting
- Configurable schemas for consistent output

### Image Analysis
- Claude supports image uploads and analysis
- Automatic routing to Claude for image tasks
- Fallback to text-based analysis if needed

### Multi-Modal Support
- Text and image inputs supported
- Automatic content type detection
- Provider-specific optimization

## üîê Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Keys are stored in browser localStorage
- Keys are sent only to respective APIs
- Consider implementing server-side key management for production

### Data Privacy
- Claude and DeepSeek have different privacy policies
- Review data handling practices for each provider
- Consider data sensitivity when choosing providers
